# System Controller - Claude Development Notes

## Project Overview
Cross-platform remote system control application in Rust for mouse/keyboard control, display capture, and window management.

## Development Status

- **Started**: 2025-08-18
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-18

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Build project
cargo build

# Run with logging
cargo run -- --help

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check for issues
cargo check
cargo clippy
```

## Development Log

### 2025-08-18 - Initial Planning
- ‚úÖ Created project structure and documentation
- ‚úÖ Researched cross-platform dependencies
- ‚úÖ Designed modular architecture with 6 implementation phases
- ‚úÖ Documented security considerations and network protocol
- üìù **Next**: Begin Phase 1 - Core Dependencies & Project Setup

## Current Issues & Solutions

### Identified Challenges
1. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Different APIs for input/display on each OS
   - **Solution**: Use `enigo` for input, platform-specific modules for advanced features

2. **Screen capture performance**: Large image data transmission
   - **Solution**: Implement compression and streaming protocols

3. **Security concerns**: Remote system control is sensitive
   - **Solution**: TLS encryption, token auth, rate limiting, audit logs

## Architecture Decisions

### Key Dependencies Chosen
- `enigo`: Proven cross-platform input simulation
- `screenshots`: Simple screen capture API  
- `tokio`: Async networking for better performance
- `serde`: JSON protocol serialization

### Module Structure
- Separate platform-specific implementations
- Clean separation of input, display, network concerns
- Extensible protocol design for future features

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1 Preparation
- Need to add dependencies to Cargo.toml
- Create module structure in src/
- Set up basic CLI with clap

### Security Requirements
- **IMPORTANT**: This is a defensive tool for legitimate remote access
- Must implement proper authentication and encryption
- Include audit logging for compliance
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Known Dependencies Status
- ‚úÖ Basic Rust project structure exists
- ‚è≥ Core dependencies need to be added
- ‚è≥ Platform-specific crates need research
- ‚è≥ Module structure needs creation

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for cross-platform compatibility
- Security testing for network components
- Performance testing for screen capture

## Deployment Considerations
- Binary distribution for each platform
- Configuration file for server settings
- Service/daemon installation scripts
- Documentation for remote client setup
